## About the Repository  

This repository demonstrates how to apply OOP principles in TypeScript, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. Each example is a standalone system built with TypeScript to showcase real-world applications of OOP concepts.

## Features  

- **OOP Concepts**: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction demonstrated with practical examples.  
- **Real-World Systems**: Examples like e-commerce, library management, and vehicle systems for hands-on learning.  
- **TypeScript Best Practices**: Adherence to TypeScript conventions and best practices for OOP.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).  
- Install TypeScript globally:  
  ```bash  
  npm install -g typescript  
  ```  

### Clone the Repository  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/oop-typescript.git  
cd oop-typescript  
```  

### Install Dependencies  
```bash  
npm install  
```  

### Compile TypeScript Files  
```bash  
tsc  
```  

### Run Examples  
Use Node.js to execute the compiled JavaScript files:  
```bash  
node e-commerce-system/eCommerceSystem.js  
```  

Or, directly run TypeScript files using `ts-node` (if installed):  
```bash  
npx ts-node e-commerce-system/eCommerceSystem.ts  
```  

## Usage  

1. **Explore OOP Concepts**: Navigate through folders to understand specific OOP implementations.  
2. **Modify Examples**: Extend the provided examples to practice advanced concepts.  
3. **Run Examples**: Compile and execute the TypeScript files to see the systems in action.
